# Hello!
This is a repo I created to showcase personal coding projects I've worked on before, as well as to share general information about me and my experience programming.

## What kinds of projects can you find here?
Although the main focus of this repo is showcasing data science projects, namely case studies and other interesting applications, this repo contains other stuff, such as machine learning applications, I've also developed over the years stuff related to other fields like web programming or even artificial intelligence, so there is some of that as well.

## How to browse each section
Each section project contains a README file to explain the general concept and/or information, browsing through the subfolders you might find yourself in areas that need more explanation or background, you will find more README files there to get a hold of the files therein. Eeel free to move around and see what you might find interesting!
