In this sub you'll find a few interesting projects:

`CNN.TrafficSignDetection` is a project that comprises a neural network that takes as input a subdirectory of images from a myriad of traffic sign categories and trains a model utilizing a subset of the data over a series of dataset iterations in order to classify traffic sign images.

`CS50ai` is probably the most juicy sub in this repo so far, in there you'll find files organized by week─as the course it is part of is organized this way─each comprising a wide range of AI topics, we're talking about going from stuff related to search algorithms all the way to natural language interpretation. Be sure to look inside for more details!

`HorseOrHuman.Classifier` is a pretty straightforward sub, in there you'll find a neural network trained using pictures of humans and horses with a diverse set of configurations so as to classify new photos that you can input yourself!
