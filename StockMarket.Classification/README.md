# Stock Market Direction Classification

This is a short project focused on applying a few classification modeling approaches to predict stock market fluctuations. The main goal of this analysis is to understand how different mathematical modeling techniques may help with taking away some of the complexity out of the stock market. Ultimately, a comparison will be made between the models used for this case study in order to see which one performs the best, as well as looking at some of the limitations and considerations needed to take into account for these kinds of applications.

# How did I performed the analysis?

This analysis was made using `R`. I performed a few regression modeling techniques in order to plug in a few predictors and obtain predictions based on these. A couple of useful libraries I used that helped with modeling were `MASS` for some of the main functions, as well as `ISRL2`, the latter being the source of the data.

The methodology I followed for this analysis came from:

-   James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T., & Tibshirani, R. (2021). An introduction to statistical learning: With applications in r (2nd ed.). Springer.

Who also made the `ISLR2` library.
