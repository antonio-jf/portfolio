# Welcome to Bycicle analytics! :bike:

This is a project based on a case study from Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate. It consists of analyzing monthly data from a company called Cyclistic, based on a real company called *Divvy*.

*This is an ongoing project and will receive updates regularly*

# Introduction

## Context

Cyclistic is a business that offers bike-sharing subscriptions to people in Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Moreover, the company offers different types of membership alternatives that accomodate to users' preferences and needs, users that use single-trip and daily passes are referred to as 'casual' users, on the other hand, those who get annual memberships are referred to as 'members'.

As you can already imagine, gathering usage data from this service is very important for the company and it's critical analysis plays a key role in decision-making and marketing.

According to finance analysts at Cyclistic, members are more profitable than casuals so the main goal of this case study is to analyze the way both of this consumer types behave in order to come up with useful insights that may help converting casual into members.

## How the data is being processed? :control_knobs:

The language I'm using for this analysis is mostly `R`, and due to the nature of the language itself I've decided not to use a `SQL` database for querying over data and just do it all in plain `R`. The data used for this project has been downloaded directly from [Divvy's website](https://divvybikes.com/system-data) and hasn't been included in the files corresponding to this project due to storage constraints[^readme-1]. However, any code used to load it, wrangle it, and overall manipulate it will be available in this repo.

[^readme-1]: Although you shouldn't have any problems trying to reproduce the results achieved in this project, any critique and comment will be adressed as soon as possible to keep everything consistent.

## Questions to be answered

1.  How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2.  Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3.  How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
