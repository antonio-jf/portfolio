# Web Programming
This sub showcases some of the applications related to webdesign I've coded.

`CS50x.FinalProject` is the capstone of Harvard's CS50x course. For this project I created a simple web application using `Flask` that creates visualizations extracting data from a database using `SQLite3` and renders graphs and charts using `matplotlib` according to the information the user wants to see.
