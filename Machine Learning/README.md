# Machine Learning
This is a sub dedicated to showcase machine learning programs I've created.

`StockMarket.Classification`: in this project I created a simple machine learning model that takes information for a given stock and attempts to predict, according to lag values, which direction will the market go on a given day, whether the value will increase or not. For this project a few approaches, such as linear regression and logistic regression, were taken in order to analyze which gave the best results.
