This is a project I made as part of Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate. It consists of analyzing monthly data from a company called *Divvy*.

## Context
Divvy is a business that offers bike-sharing subscriptions to people in Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and
returned to any other station in the system anytime. Moreover, the company offers different types of membership alternatives that accomodate to users' preferences and needs, users that use single-trip and daily passes are referred to as 'casual' users, on the other hand, those who get annual memberships are referred to as 'members'. 

As you can already imagine, gathering usage data from this service is very important for the company and it's critical analysis plays a key role in decision-making and marketing.
