# Welcome to Bycicle analytics!
This is a project I made as part of Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate. It consists of analyzing monthly data from a company called *Divvy*.

## Context
Divvy is a business that offers bike-sharing subscriptions to people in Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and
returned to any other station in the system anytime. Moreover, the company offers different types of membership alternatives that accomodate to users' preferences and needs, users that use single-trip and daily passes are referred to as 'casual' users, on the other hand, those who get annual memberships are referred to as 'members'. 

As you can already imagine, gathering usage data from this service is very important for the company and it's critical analysis plays a key role in decision-making and marketing.

## Considerations
The language I'm using for this analysis is `R`, and due to the nature of the language itself I've decided not to use a `SQL` database for querying over data and just do it all in plain `R`. 
The data used for this project has been downloaded directly from [Divvy's website](https://divvybikes.com/system-data) and hasn't been included in the files corresponding to this project due to storage constraints[^1]. However, any code used to load it, wrangle it, and overall manipulate it will be available in this repo.

#### A final report will be available once the project has reached it's endpoint.

[^1]: Although you shouldn't have any problems trying to reproduce the results achieved in this project, any critique and comment will be adressed as soon as possible to keep everything consistent.
