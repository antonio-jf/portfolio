# CS50ai
A subdirectory for my cs50ai code.

## What is CS50ai?
CS50ai is an intermediate Harvard online course focused on teaching Artificial Intelligence fundamentals with Python through lectures and a fully fledged seven-week program.
After every weekly lecture there are program implementations a course-taker is expected to be able to solve which include concepts seen in the lectures, as well as some aditional concepts related to the content.

## What can you find in this subdirectory?
Here you can find my solutions for CS50ai.
A brief description of what each code does is found below. Feel free to go over the code in each of the subdirectories and take a look at the code.
