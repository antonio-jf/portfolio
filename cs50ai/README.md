# CS50ai
A subdirectory for my cs50ai code.

## What is CS50ai?
CS50ai is an intermediate Harvard online course focused on teaching Artificial Intelligence fundamentals with Python through lectures and a fully fledged seven-week program.
After every weekly lecture there are program implementations a course-taker is expected to be able to solve which include concepts seen in the lectures, as well as some aditional concepts related to the content.

## What can you find in this subdirectory?
Basically, here you can find my solutions for CS50ai's problems.
A brief description of what each code does is found below. Feel free to go over the code in each of the subdirectories and take a look at the code.

### Week 0
- In `degrees` you can find code created for a breadth-first search algorithm which has the main goal of iterating over movies and finding a link between two people by means of the people they have co-starred with. 
- In `tictactoe` the main goal of the program is to implement an tictactoe playing AI algorithm which is impossible to beat.
### Week 1
- In `knights` the task was to knowledge-engineer a series of logical sentences so as to help an AI to understand how to classify a series of Knights and Knaves.
- In `minesweeper` an AI has been implemented to play minesweeper on its own, beating the game according to knowledge that is being acquired as it progresses. 
### Week 2
- `heredity` is a program that
