# Analytics and Visualizations

This sub is dedicated to show some analytics projects and at the same time some of the visualizations used for those projects, as well as some others independent thereof.

`BycicleAnalytics` is part of the Google Analytics course I decided to take a while back and it consists of a problem set by the marketing team of a bycicle rental company that aims to sell subscriptions to its users. In this project some visualizations are created to further illustrate key insights that could be of use for the aforementioned marketing team.
